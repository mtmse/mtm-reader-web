# Styling

The package exports a set of CSS that can be imported in your app or serve as a reference for your own styles.

## Usage

### PublicationGrid and StatefulLoader

The `PublicationGrid` and `StatefulLoader` are not part of `StatefulReader` in practice, so their styles are exported in the `misc` package.

```tsx
import "@edrlab/thorium-web/misc/styles";
```

### Epub StatefulReader

When using the `StatefulReader` component for EPUB, the styles are exported in the `epub` package.

> [!NOTE]
> This stylesheet contains styles for `html` and `body`, as well as a necessary reset for buttons and inputs. Please bear in mind that it may override styles for these elements if the stylesheet is imported last in your page.

```tsx
import "@edrlab/thorium-web/epub/styles";
```

### WebPub StatefulReader

When using the `StatefulReader` component for WebPub, the styles are exported in the `webpub` package.

> [!NOTE]
> This stylesheet contains styles for `html` and `body`, as well as a necessary reset for buttons and inputs. Please bear in mind that it may override styles for these elements if the stylesheet is imported last in your page.

```tsx
import "@edrlab/thorium-web/webpub/styles";
```

## Advanced

Although easily importable, you can also copy the styles from:

- `dist/components/Misc/index.css`
- `dist/components/Epub/index.css`
- `dist/components/WebPub/index.css`

And customize them as needed.

## Customization

The entire list of class names is available in the [API docs](./API.md).

### Class names

Classes are following pattern `thorium_web_` + module name + component name e.g. `.thorium_web_button_icon`, `.thorium_web_overflow_menu`, or `.thorium_web_sheets_popover`.

`StatefulReader` also provides the following layouts and states:

- `.thorium_web_stackedUI`/`.thorium_web_layeredUI`: the type of layout used, derived from preference `layout.ui`

  - `.thorium_web_isExpanded`

### Component states

For components themselves, you can use the `data` attribute referenced in [React Aria documentation](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) e.g. `[data-pressed]`, `[data-hovered]`, `[data-focus-visible]`, `[data-disabled]`
